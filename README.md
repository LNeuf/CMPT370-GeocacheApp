# Geocache App
 A project done for CMPT 370

 An application built to solve a non-trivial problem. This app allows people to find geocaches (a real life find the treasure). Users can view the location on Google Maps and directly track it from their location. A list of caches is also available for simpler navigation and sorting. Caches are stored in a database and are laoded based on proximity to user. Also has a cache creation menu, allowing people to create a new custom cache.
